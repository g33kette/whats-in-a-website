 Parks, sport and leisure centres If you're feeling active, visit one of our leisure centres offering a host of sporting activities or take a stroll through one of our many parks that also boast a range of activities. We are lucky enough to have several skateparks in the area with different facilities and equipment, visit our skateparks page to find one near you.
