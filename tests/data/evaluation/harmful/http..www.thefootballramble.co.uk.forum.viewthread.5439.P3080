Joe - 15 January 2019 02:50 PM RKMF - 15 January 2019 02:30 PM Interesting to hear that Giuseppe Rossi is back training with the club, and has been impressing Alex Ferguson apparently. Wouldn’t mind taking him on a short-term deal until the summer if nobody else signs him.  

Is Ferguson just hanging around the training ground then?    

Fergie removing the OGS mask at the end of the season when United end up surging up the table:

He clearly learned from the Busby experiment of returning to United and tinkered with it.

I’d be all for a deal if he suited the way we are playing. However it seems we are now coming to a style, to which the likes of Fellaini and even Lukaku just won’t suit. I haven’t seen Rossi in a long time, so no idea if or how he plays anymore.   
I found it wierd how little people have talked about that, it seems quite a big change. 

No idea how he is these days, but Id love Rossi to get a game. Always hoped hed do well, injuries really screwed him.

He’s been there once at least, could be more but only one confirmed attendance at training as far as I know.

Even as someone with no particular affinity to anyone he played for seeing Rossi’s name makes me sad, looked at Villarreal like he could be brilliant, and even when he’d had his first couple of big injuries he had a superb season at Fiorentina before it all fell apart again. Still, we’ll always have the 2009 Confederations Cup.

It hardly seems as though he is casting a huge shadow, other than for Moyes who visibly shrank in his shade. Otherwise I think he has given the club, managers and players plenty of room, whilst still being a part of the club.

Yeah, that’s why I asked, because it seems like he’s given the club loads of space in order to allow the manager to work. Any time the match is on, he’s at it and the camera pans to him, hardly his fault. He’s not been doing loads of interviews or anything like that saying what should and shouldn’t be done.  

  

Fuck it, we could have done with him over the last 3-4 years sticking his nose in

Just to outdo Hank on the Chelsea thread, check this out for a fixture run: 

12 Feb: CL - PSG (Home) 
16 Feb: FA - Chelsea (Away) 
24 Feb: PL - Liverpool (Home) 
27 Feb: PL - C Palace (Away) 
2 Mar: PL - Southampton (Home) 
6 Mar: CL - PSG (Away) 
10 Mar: PL - Arsenal (Away) 
16 Mar: PL.- Man City (Home) 

Going to need every ounce of Ole’s magic for that run, could realistically see us coming out with one, maybe two wins.

What would happen to the calls for him to get the job permanently be if that happened? 

I think even if that run goes badly you are still favourites for the Chelsea, Palace, Southampton and Arsenal games. 

It feel oh so predictable that we have to go to OT when Utd have found some sparkling form while needed to petty much needing to win every game from now until May.

Just seen that Fred turns 26 today. 26!! I honestly thought he was about 21/22. I’m all for giving players a chance, but fuck, if he’s this bad at 26 I’m not sure he has much of a future at this level.

Not sure where I heard it, some pod or another, and it immediately set my bullshit detector off. But I recall someone saying that Fred was bought as part of Jose’s plan to run Pogba out of the club. Which made zero sense to me as the two aren’t remotely comparable, and I’d always thought of it as a you-can’t-have-him-Citeh signing, or some bizarre result of the internecine Ed-Jose war.

The game kicks off at 01:30 in the night where I’m at… seriously conflicted whether I should stay up and watch given the only hope of turning it around is Rashford and Lukaku doing their thing while the defence keeps them out at the other end. If recent history is anything to go by, the one team that can collapse spectacularly after a commanding first leg advantage is PSG.

Poor Malmo, the biggest losers in all of this  sad  

Are Spurs the biggest winners of the events of the last 3 weeks? Poch went from the #1 option for both Real Madrid and Manchester United to most likely not having any vacancies at any of the big hitters and him leaving Spurs to go somewhere outside of a handful of clubs would be a lateral move.

It’ll likely be alright for a good while. Not too sure how much he’ll materially be able to achieve, but he’s a United fellow. He ought to comfortably keep them in race for 3rd-4th spot next season, so long as he stays flexible and does his homework ahead of bigger fixtures. If he can rebuild a fraction of MU’s former fearsomeness, that’ll be enough of an achievement.

As it’s not confirmed yet still hoping he’ll decide to stay. But this all goes back to stupid short-term vanity signings like Sanchez and Ibrahimovic that completely fucked the wage structure and has made it much harder to negotiate with existing squad members. Woodward and Mourinho’s frivolity might take a long time to fix.

RKMF - 28 April 2019 06:57 PM I wrote the following on the way home after the City game the other day but held off on posting as I thought it might be knee-jerk, but a few days later I think it still accurately reflects my thoughts: 

—————————————————————— 

For me the squad can be split into 3 fairly even groups at the moment. 

Players I will drive to the airport myself so they fuck off ASAP - Sanchez, Pogba, Young, Jones, Smalling, Fred, Darmian. 

Players I wouldn’t be disappointed to see leave - Lukaku, Matic, Pereira, Lingard, Bailly, Rojo, Grant, De Gea (may be controversial, but I think his best might be behind him). 

Like to keep - Shaw, Dalot, Lindelof, Herrera, McTominay, Rashford, Martial, Mata (for sentiment more than anything), Romero as long as he remains backup. 

And Valencia is leaving anyway. 

A lot of work to do. It’s going to take years.  

Thought it’s better to bring this here before replying.  

My groups wpuld be very similar to yours, other than: 
 Pogba would be in the like to keep, his stats are better than his press, and is the sole world class player we have.  
Lingard and De Gea also in the like to keep, De Gea dependent on signing a new contract or getting a meda transfer fee for him. 

For me it’s absolutely essential we rid ourselves of Sanchez, even if we have to pay him to fuck off. His wages have fucked the structure within the squad, with others (understandably/deservedly) wanting wages in the same magnitude as him.  

Utter madness that having spent the ampunts we have that a full squad overhaul is needed. All that money wasted. Imagine if SAF had been given half the money we’ve spent after him in his final three years…

If you look back now at the squad when Ferguson retired, so 6 years ago, the players that are still at the club now are Jones, Smalling, Young, Valencia and De Gea. De Gea has been immense the last year aside, but the other 4 are all well past their best (did Jones’ even have a best?) and frankly could have all left a year or two ago. But what this means is that the squad that Fergie left behind had one player in the entire squad that was going to be good enough to stay at the club for another 5 or 6 years. That’s a pretty damning indictment of how poorly that side was prepared for the future, RVP was the big difference that year and masked some real deficiencies. 

Now just to be clear, I’m not blaming Fergie, but rather the poor decision making and recruitment of those that have followed since, mainly Woodward. Most of the time Fergie’s summer would be 2 or 3 new signings and maybe promote one from the youth team and see if he’s any good. If we had carried on with the same ethos the squad would have refreshed itself by now 6 years later, but signings like Zlatan, Falcao, Schweinsteiger and Sanchez have been totally against the mentality and idea of the type of player we should be signing. Wrong end of their careers, massive wages. Then there’s knee-jerk signings like Rojo and Darmian off a few good World Cup games. We made bad signings under Fergie too but the frequency was nowhere near as high. And the risk was nowhere near as high either, it was usually cheap signings on fairly low wages like Djemba-Djemba, Obertan, Kleberson. The irresponsibility of the recruitment the last 5 years (I’m not including the Moyes season as we only signed Mata and Fellaini and promoted Januzaj which wasn’t too out of the ordinary) has left the squad in a terrible state. 

There is no quick fix, it’ll take years. An overhaul won’t gel quickly and with FFP might not even be possible to do in one season. But FFS don’t make the same mistakes again for the love of God.

From my years attending Utd during the 90s and early 00s you are virtually unrecognisable as a club to me now. SAF was effectively the worlds most powerful director of football. Too powerful ultimately as Moyes was clearly the wrong style of manager for the club that played the way you did, I do think he choose him out of some sort of romantic Scottish charm or something. And since then there has been too many shifts and changes and no plan in place long term, Moyes > Van Gaal > Mouriniho - all very different in style and tactical approach but all worked with that same squad, or worse brought in there players or tried to get players for their styles. 

 Pissed away millions and got embroiled in chasing big names, rather than doing a mixture of flashy signings and solid signings.

Yeah, this. It’s like Woodward read a book about the Galacticos but someone had ripped out the chapter about how they won (relatively) fuck all

Doing what RKMF did 

Hope leave - Rojo, Smalling, Matic, Sanchez 

Not bothered either way - Romero and Grant (But would prefer we didnt have to sign reserve keepers), Young, Darmian, Jones, Fred, Pereira, Pogba (If he wants to stay keep him, if not out), Lukaku (Depends if hed be happy on the bench. 

Hope Stay - De Gea for now, Shaw, Dalot, Lindelof, Bailly, Hererra, McTominay, Mata, Martial, Rashford, Lingard 

 
Those four leaving pretty much cover the main issue areas (Full backs to cover Dalot and Shaw, first choice CB, first choice DM (One of the last two being am organiser) and an attacker).

Ander Herrera has posted a goodbye message to the fans. So that’s that confirmed. I’d have loved to have kept him, but can you blame the guy, he’s 29 and PSG will win far more in the next 4 years than we will, and will be in the Champions League every year too. Hopefully he’ll play tomorrow so we can give him a send off. 

So looks like we’ll definitely be buying at least one midfielder.

Greenwood, Rashford, Lingard. Front 3 of academy players, lovely stuff. And if we count Pogba so is the midfield with McTominay and Pereira. Looks like Valencia will get one last outing from the bench too. No Ander though  cry

It annoys me how things ended up. Waited too long to offer him a deal, dont give him what others earn and leaves us having to fill another squad spot in addition to the essentials.

All academy front six yet the calamity trio still in defence. Really hoping Tuanzebe gets a chance next season. Shame Herrera isn’t afforded a send off, other than the cringeworthy video.

I know we should be drawing a line under the season right now, but one last rant if I may. 

How in the flying fuck have Ashley Young and Phil Jones got new contracts? Chris Smalling is poor, but he’s like Beckenbauer compared to those two useless twats. What even is Phil Jones? I don’t think there’s a single team in the Premier League he doesn’t struggle to defend against. This suggests not only is he not good enough for United, I don’t even think he’s good enough for the Premier League, he’s a constant accident waiting to happen. Every single cross or corner Young does hits the first man, all of them. He’s an average passer and a mediocre defender. Seeing him with the captain’s armband is a weekly embarrassment. 

Just to be positive for a minute Greenwood was our best player in the first half and shame he couldn’t put one of those chances away to cap it. A lot of love for McTominay too, he’s matured brilliantly in the last few months and is the only one to come out of this recent shit patch with any credit.

Just having similar conversations with a united fan mate, updated my list from a few weeks ago: 

De Gea - sign new contract or fuck off 
Romero - meh 
Grant - fuck off 

Young - fuck off 
Valencia - fuck off 
Dalot - keep, for promise only 
Darmian - fuck off 
Shaw - meh 
Smalling - fuck off 
Jones - fuck off 
Lindelof - keep 
Bailly - fuck off 
Rojo - fuck off 

Herrera - keep, oh.  
Matic - fuck off 
Periera - meh 
Mctominay - keep for potential only 
Pogba - fuck off 
Fred - fuck off 

Mata - keep for being nice, otherwise fuck off 
Martial - starting to think fuck off 
Lingard - fuck off 
Sanchez - FUCK OFF 
Rashford - keep 
Lukaku - meh 

I don’t think I was even that hyperbolic. What a fucking mess.

^There were points in the game where I just felt like fuck off the lot of them. But yeah I pretty much agree with the above give or take a few. I’d be happy to send Bailly out on loan, I feel like there might be a player in there but he needs games and we can’t risk it with him. The more I see of Pereira the less he seems like a top level player. He’s alright, but no better. The big worry is a lot of this shite will stay as it’s hard to turn over that many players in one summer.

We kept only 7 CS this season as compared to 19 last season. I agree when someone says DDG was standing on his head and keeping literally everything out last season and he has been quite error prone, but what about the rest of the back 4? Valencia who played RB for the entire previous season didn’t play this season due to injury but the performances of the rest of them have just fallen off a cliff. Can’t just be a confidence thing. 
I cannot wait to see the back of Rojo, what a shocking signing he has been. Injury prone and a walking red card whenever he was on the pitch. Personally I would fine all those who were involved in the ‘scouting’ of Rojo because I genuinely do not understand what they saw in him in terms of a player that would fit into the United mould.

Jesse Lingard is 26. 

I thought he was about 22. This news has properly knocked me for 6.
