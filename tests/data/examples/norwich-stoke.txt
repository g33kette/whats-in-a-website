Stoke continue revival with Norwich win

Stoke end Norwich's eight-match unbeaten run with a 1-0 win at Carrow Road thanks to Timm Klose's own goal.

Norwich City dropped out of the play-off places after Timm Klose's first-half own goal ensured a second win in three games for Stoke City, who move within two points of the top six.

The loss ends an eight-match unbeaten run for Daniel Farke's side, and comes despite them dominating the game in terms of both possession and chances.

Cuco Martina's cross was turned into his own net by Swiss defender Klose 10 minutes before half-time to put the Potters in front.

It proved crucial as Norwich were unable to take chances for Mario Vrancic and Marco Stiepermann, with England international goalkeeper Jack Butland turning in an inspired display.

Stoke might have nicked a second goal late on when Benik Afobe failed to get a clean shot away and a well-placed Tom Ince was unable to bury the follow-up.

After a tough start to life in the Potteries despite their pre-season favourites tag, Gary Rowett has started to find some form with his Stoke side, as this victory stretches their unbeaten run to three matches and lifts them to 13th in the table.

Only goal difference keeps Norwich outside the play-off spots despite this loss, although they have a zero goal difference with 15 scored, and 15 conceded in their 12 games so far.

Norwich head coach Daniel Farke told BBC Radio Norfolk:

"It's very disappointing and difficult to accept this result after watching the 90 minutes.

"It's a ridiculous result. Normally even one point would be less than we deserved because only one team was playing, attacking, creating chances.

"Anyhow, congratulations to Stoke and Gary Rowett.

"Sometimes football is not fair and this is one of these days - they won a game without creating a chance, through an own-goal.

Stoke manager Gary Rowett told BBC Radio Stoke:

"The game plan wasn't to have a lot less possession than Norwich, but you could see we started with less energy than them.

"What I'd say is the negative was the poor attacking performance, but the positives were the very resolute and organised defensive performance.

"Tactically we were excellent and we haven't won enough games like that this season.

"We've shown a different way of winning a game which is very, very positive."
