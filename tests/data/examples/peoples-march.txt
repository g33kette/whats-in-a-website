People's Vote march: Hundreds of thousands attend London protest

Protesters seeking a referendum on the final Brexit deal have attended a rally which organisers say was the "biggest" demonstration of its kind.

Young voters led the People's Vote march to London's Parliament Square, which supporters say attracted approximately 700,000 protesters.

MPs from the main parties backed the event calling for a fresh referendum.

This is something which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May.

The People's Vote campaign said stewards on the route estimated 700,000 were taking part.

Scotland Yard said it was not able to estimate the size of the crowd.

The march was held at the same time as a pro-Brexit rally in Harrogate, organised by the group Leave Means Leave and led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

Mr Farage said: "The evidence suggests about a third of those that voted remain now say we're democrats and think the government should simply get on with it.

"And that's our message - get on with it, fulfil your promises to us, you said if we voted to leave it would happen, it needs to."

People gathered on Park Lane for hours before the march. Many held home-made signs and banners with slogans like "the wrexiteers", "Brexit stole my future" and "Even Baldrick had a plan."

As the crowds began to form, the sheer scale of the protest became clear. Thousands of people stretched in front and behind us, some were singing, others were playing instruments while many plastic whistles blared out.

There were lots of young families there, some with children wrapped in EU flags. Many told me they'd gone because they were worried about their families' future.

Some people marched in groups, there were NHS staff, political parties, members of the LGBT community and dog owners. Many took the opportunity to dress up their pets for the protest.

The start of the march was delayed due to the number of people there. As news and police helicopters circled we set off just after one.

It was a good natured and friendly march through some of London's most famous streets before the hundreds of thousands of people arrived at Parliament Square. By that stage the march was so large that not everyone could fit in the square and we spilled out onto nearby streets.

The marchers are hoping people power will persuade the British government to hold a referendum on the final Brexit deal. They will have to wait and see if the government was listening.

The British public voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016.

The UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process.
