Stoke continue revival with Norwich win

Norwich City dropped out of the play-off places after Timm Klose's first-half own goal ensured a second win in three games for Stoke City, who move within two points of the top six.

Cuco Martina's cross was turned into his own net by Swiss defender Klose 10 minutes before half-time to put the Potters in front.

Stoke might have nicked a second goal late on when Benik Afobe failed to get a clean shot away and a well-placed Tom Ince was unable to bury the follow-up.

Only goal difference keeps Norwich outside the play-off spots despite this loss, although they have a zero goal difference with 15 scored, and 15 conceded in their 12 games so far.
