A week of RISE!

We are kicking off a week of RISE on the Find What Feels Good Yoga Membership and everyone is invited!

Today the mantra is… YES.

Yes ma’am.

Yes sir.

Yes please.

Yes to Yoga – the union, the unknown – the reality of what is and what feels good.

Woah.

Just a little bit of awareness each day goes a long way.

So today’s simple reminder…

Say Yes.

What can you say yes to?

Yes to your yoga practice?

Yes to a water with lemon before your coffee?

Yes to saying “I love you” before “hurry up!”

Yes to forgiveness.

Yes to moving on.

Yes to new beginnings.

Say yes to your neighbor blasting opera at full volume.

Yes to this idea of rising up, rising above and yes to showing up for yourself each day.

Write it down – what are you going to say YES to today?

Now, I know that there is a time and a place where we need to be able to say NO. But when it comes to the RISE launch and this idea of mindful mornings and how that can bleed into our our everyday. I’m saying YES.

 Here are some YES vibes coming from the Kula:

“I just have to tell you, I caved. I’m a grad student on a budget, and I tried to tell myself Rise would have to wait. I just couldn’t. Did Rise Day 1 today. I was so invigorated and so inspired that I immediately cued the Foundations of Flow video and dove into more. Thank you, Adriene, for inspiring this community. Thank you community for being a safe place to learn and grow. Thank you yoga for helping me overcome migraines and computer postures, and encouraging me to eat better and find what feels good. I say yes to my adventures. I say yes to self care. I say yes to not letting setbacks overcome me. Namaste, my friends.”  – Shelly

“I just said YES to a morning with RISE. Yes to yummie, sleepy stretches. Yes to the drive across Europe today with pretty fall foliage all around me. Yes to my giant mug of coffee this morning. Yes to my workplace. Yes to a flat that begins to feel like home. Yes to both parents alive. Yes to internet and a way to find what feels good. Yes to discovering Adriene a year ago. Yes to my daily yoga fix. YES, I am so happy to be part of this kula! Wishing you all a happy day. YES, dare to be happy! smile emoticon I dare. Do you?”- Marta
