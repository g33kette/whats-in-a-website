\t Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana in James Cameron's 'Avatar'  Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana in James Cameron's 'Avatar' 20th Century Fox    When Kevin Feige confirmed rumblings of a theatrical reissue for Walt Disney and Marvel’s Avengers: Endgame  a week from today, complete with a new credit cookie and a tribute of sorts, the immediate presumption was that it was an attempt to earn the additional $45 million that the MCU movie needed to pass the $2.788 billion worldwide gross of Fox’s Avatar . I still maintain that a mere “expanding wide again while still in semi-wide release” reissue isn’t enough to push over the milestone, and that the push was more about helping Sony’s Spider-Man: Far From Home  (which allegedly acts as an epilogue to the MCU’s “Infinity Saga”). But even if it does happen, there are two things worth noting.  First, to the extent that it matters, the notion that Avengers: Endgame  needing a quick upswing in theater counts to do the deed would constitute cheating or a Roger Maris asterisk is not fair or accurate. Sure, neither Avatar  nor Titanic  needed theatrical re-releases to crush the domestic and global box office records in their day, even if both films eventually got releases after the fact. Avatar  earned an additional $33 million worldwide (including $11 million domestic) from a late-summer 2010 return engagement. Oh, and Titanic  went out as a 3-D attraction in early 2012 to the tune of $58 million domestic and $286 million overseas, which pushed the film’s global cume from $1.8 billion in 1997/1998 to $2.187 billion.  Its “new” $659 million domestic cume is why it still is technically “ahead” of Incredibles 2  ($608 million in 2018), The Last Jedi  ($620 million in 2018), The Avengers  ($623 million in 2012) and Jurassic World  ($652 million in 2015). And, yeah, Star Wars  needed that “Special Edition” reissue in 1997 to leapfrog from $322 million to $460 million and thus over E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial ’s then-$399 million total domestic cume just under a year before Titanic  sailed to $600 million. That’s not even getting into inflation, 3-D bumps or overseas expansion, but yes, many of the biggest movies of all time (Gone with the Wind , Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , Star Wars , etc.) have benefitted from theatrical rereleases.   That being said, if Avengers: Endgame  is still technically in theaters before June 28 anyway, then it arguably doesn’t count as a re-release in the traditional sense. While I still maintain that it’s in Walt Disney’s best interest for Avatar  to remain the all-time global champ, it’s possible that they are indeed willing to do Kevin Feige, presuming he cares about any of this, a solid as Marvel is by far Disney’s most valuable IP at the moment. Would Disney trade annoying James Cameron and/or making it harder to sell Avatar 2  in two years (since it will no longer be the biggest movie ever) in order to keep the House of Ideas on the Terms of Good? Maybe.  That said, if Avatar ’s global record falls, that will only increase the desire for Avatar 2  to strike lightning for the second time. If Avatar  falling to sad/shameful second place means that James Cameron will triple down to make sure that Avatar 2  will (paraphrasing Mr. Cameron) make us shit ourselves with our mouths wide open, well, then I’ll gladly contribute a few bucks toward Endgame ’s final domestic push. Cameron will presumably be even more determined to prove that Avatar  wasn’t a fluke or merely about folks freaking out over 3-D. Frankly, I’d argue that determination will apply to Walt Disney as well. It is 104% in Disney’s interest that Avatar 2  blows our socks off in December of 2021.

 Since Fox is now under the Disney umbrella, it will be Disney’s responsibility to make sure that the Avatar  franchise does its thing in alternating Christmases (2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027) before and after the next three Star Wars  movies in 2022, 2024 and 2026. That’s especially true because we have no idea how moviegoers will react to new Star Wars  movies, be they Knights of the Republic  flicks or not, that feature no explicit connection to the Skywalker/Solo movies. The next Star Wars  is the (global) underdog alongside James Wan’s Aquaman  sequel which is still slotted for the same December 20, 2022 release date. Disney successfully reigniting interest in Avatar  will be a hell of a feather in their cap. The good news is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, all evidence suggests that Avatar 2 , presuming it’s halfway decent blockbuster entertainment, is still likely to crush all comers when it finally opens. As the guy who wrote that “Avatar  has made no pop culture impact” article 4.5 years ago, I’d say its cultural footprint (if only in terms of visuals and world building) has grown since late 2014. And while it was received as something unto itself 9.5 years ago, it will be sold as a bloody miracle when the time comes, an entirely original, director-driven audio-visual knockout that combined glorious fantasy myth making and of-the-moment politics to become (by far) the biggest movie of all time. Oh, and people like it. Avatar  received good-to-great reviews upon release, with any number of “Holy crap, the crazy son-of-a-bitch did it!” raves (including mine) leading to a $77 million debut weekend (the biggest for a live-action original) and a leggy late-2009/early-2010 run that pushed the film to $749 million domestic and $2.75 billion global. It was nominated for several major Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. It currently stands at 82% fresh with a 7.43/10 average critic score on Rotten Tomatoes . Its Rotten Tomatoes  audience score is 82% with over 1.3 million voters and an average score of 4.13/5. It’s also at 83 on Metacritic  with a 7.5 audience score. Its IMDB  user score is 7.8/10 from over one million users. Those user scores aren’t an exact science. However, unless there’s a contingent of hardcore Pandora fans out there up-voting the movie to make sure it maintains decent audience polling scores, I’d say that’s pretty indicative of the general populace reaction. But not only did it make a ton of money in theaters, it made bank in post-theatrical as well. It remains second-biggest-selling Blu-ray behind Walt Disney’s Frozen . Among physical home viewing formats (DVD, VHS, Blu), Avatar  ranks sixth behind only various Disney toons (The Lion King , Finding Nemo , Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin ) and, uh, Titanic . The only live-action title that got close was Spider-Man , which was the first mega-blockbuster of the DVD era.  Yes, Disney must remind folks that they liked Avatar  and make sure that audiences care about seeing what happens next specifically to Sam Worthington's Jake Sully and Zoe Saldana's Neytiri. But Disney has time to do both things, with the help of its theme park attractions (like Disney World's \"World of Pandora) and Disney Stores and related merchandise. A theatrical reissue of the first Avatar , if only in IMAX 3-D and Dolby Cinema 3-D, is all-but-assured when the time comes, and it will be as much in Disney's interest to make sure folks flock to Avatar 2  as it will be to make sure that the Star Wars  IP still has top-tier value after The Rise of Skywalker .  I'm not arguing that Avatar 2  will pass Avatar  at the global box office, although a massively expanded marketplace in China from ten years ago might help in that regard. However, it is odd to look at a film that earned that much money ($2.788 billion, including $2.029 billion overseas alone), inspired that much of-the-moment fandom, sold 26.5 million DVDs and Blu-rays, earned a bunch of Oscar nominations and still maintains a healthy average in terms of user polling and critical consensus and think that the sequel is anything but a surefire hit. Even aside from the whole \"Never bet against James Cameron\" thing, we may be underestimating Avatar 2  at our collective peril.
