Emirates Old Trafford Cricket Ground is 5 minutes south of Old Trafford. Sir Matt Busby Way, which leads right up to the stadium, is closed on matchdays.

Parking  
Trafford Council operates a pay-to-park facility on event days within the Trafford Village area of Trafford Park, close to Old Trafford. The parking charge is £4 in allocated parking bays on-street. 
Payment can be made via RingGo using a mobile phone or app on the day of an event. Alternatively, vouchers to park in these bays can be purchased beforehand by telephoning (0161 912 5860). A maximum of 3 vouchers can be purchased at any one time. 
Access to car parks E1 & E2 can only be gained via Wharfside Way with the relevant permits. Anyone attempting to access via Chester Road will be directed around the traffic system, which may cause further delays. Where acting upon police instructions, supporters parking on E1 & E2 may be held back after the match and we apologise for any such delays. 
There are other council-approved facilities near to the stadium. Caution should be taken when using unapproved parking sites, as some of these are known to breach local authority parking regulations and could result in a ticket being issued, for which the club is not liable.

Old Trafford is the largest League ground in England and is one of the most iconic football venues in the world. 
The stadium was built next to the Bridgewater Canal in 1910 and, apart from an eight-year gap because of bomb damage sustained during the Second World War, it has been Man Utd's home ever since. 
There are plenty of nods to the club's illustrious past at the ground with statues of Sir Matt Busby, Sir Alex Ferguson and the 'Holy Trinity' of Denis Law, Sir Bobby Charlton and George Best located at various points around the stadium that has become known as the 'Theatre of Dreams'.
