            Paul Pogba's move to Manchester United in 2016 was the big return - #POGBACK - with plenty of unfinished business. In the coming weeks, that business may be shelved for good.   
        Sky Sports News understands the 26-year-old wants to leave Old Trafford. He recently admitted during a commercial event in Tokyo: \"It could be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else.\"    With that, the world of football braced itself for another summer-long saga.

          Manchester United transfer rumours   Get a Sky Sports Day Pass    Here, we assess the likelihood of Pogba's departure from Old Trafford, whether United will miss the Frenchman, and who could replace him... What do we know so far?   Pogba wants to leave Manchester United and wants to play in the Champions League.  The club accept they may need to sell him soon. Why? Because his value is diminishing, and with two years remaining on his current contract - plus the option of a further year - it's unlikely he will sign a new deal.                                                              Pogba improved early on under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but his late-season form dropped again                                                                                               Pogba improved early on under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but his late-season form dropped again                                   During a promotional tour in Japan, Pogba said: \"I think for me it could be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else. I am thinking of this.\" It is thought Pogba made these comments to force United to sell him. OK. He wants to leave, he's a World Cup winner, surely someone will snap him up ASAP?  This is where it gets tricky. United would take £150m for Pogba, a decent profit on the £93.25m paid in 2016, and there are three clubs in the mix, but these deals are never completed overnight, or even one week. His wages, thought to be £290k-a-week, also provide a problem... Real Madrid  - The Spanish giants want to sign Pogba, but have spent £250m on new players and have concerns over meeting Financial Fair Play requirements. The poor relationship between club president Florentino Perez and Pogba's agent Mino Raiola - bad blood between the pair that goes way back - may also be a sticking point. The bottom line is: if they really want him, they will find a solution. In March, Pogba said: \"Real Madrid is a dream for anyone. It's one of the biggest clubs in the world. There is also Zinedine Zidane as a coach and it's a dream for anybody who likes football.\" Juventus  - There are doubts Pogba's former side would pay £150m, and new boss Maurizio Sarri is thought to be unsure about his suitability, but he is  on a three-man shortlist of midfielders alongside Adrien Rabiot, who is close to signing, and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. Pogba would prefer to rejoin Juventus over a move to Real Madrid if he leaves United, according to Sky in Italy , but Juve are trying to find a way to match his wage demands before approaching United.                                                               United signed Pogba from Juventus in 2016 for a then-world-record fee of £93.25m                                                                                               United signed Pogba from Juventus in 2016 for a then-world-record fee of £93.25m                                   PSG  - The French club aren't 100 per cent keen on Pogba, but Raiola is currently talking to the club about Matthijs de Ligt, and it would be a surprise if Pogba is not at least brought up in passing... Elsewhere, Barcelona are working to bring in Antoine Griezmann, and though they wanted Pogba last summer, there is little desire this time. How do United feel about all of this?  Sky Sports News  understands  United expect Pogba to stay, but accept a situation may arise whereby it would be best to allow their record signing to depart. After all, every player has a right price. While they would ideally like to keep him, some at United are understood to have concerns about Pogba's behaviour and his negative influence over a number of the younger members of the squad.                                                               Pogba wants Champions League football after two trophyless seasons at Old Trafford                                                                                               Pogba wants Champions League football after two trophyless seasons at Old Trafford                                   Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to build a younger, hungrier side - United have signed 21-year-old Daniel James, want 19-year-old Max Aarons and have bid big for 21-year-old Aaron Wan-Bissaka - after a disappointing sixth-place finish last season, and two trophyless campaigns. How Aarons has impressed Man Utd   Juventus director: We love Pogba    Solskjaer wants to get United's business done as early as possible, and United players are due back in training at the beginning of July. After Pogba's comments in Japan, and his popularity among many players, the atmosphere will be interesting. So, what's the bottom line?  Pogba wants to leave, United will sell at the right price, but clubs have plenty of work to do get the financials right. What about a Real French connection? Spanish football expert Terry Gibson  feels a move to the Bernabeu makes sense for both Pogba and Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, but they'll have to finance it with some player sales...  Speaking on the latest Transfer Talk Podcast,  Gibson said: \"I do expect Real to sign Pogba, purely for the reason that Zidane returned to the club and was given the power he didn't have before. Zidane has been as polite as he possibly could, but he's flirted with the fact he wanted Pogba, and Pogba has made no secret.                                                               Real Madrid have spent £250m already this summer on recruits for Zinedine Zidane                                                                                               Real Madrid have spent £250m already this summer on recruits for Zinedine Zidane                                   \"You can just imagine a French midfield player wanting to go to Real Madrid, wanting to play under arguably the best French midfield player of all time who's held in such high regard. If Zidane is flirting with you to come to Real Madrid, I fear for Manchester United supporters, or those that want Pogba to stay. I think it's inevitable, though United will put up a fight and try and get as much money as they can. \"Somehow Real Madrid are finding the money; they think they are going to get more than enough money from the players they want to move on to cover the fees for Hazard, Jovic, young Rodrigo from Brazil, Militao from Porto, Mendy from Lyon and they still want to go for Pogba. They are going to have to raise some finances in terms of their player sales, but it's exciting times.\"                                                               Pogba's distance and defensive stats are far less impressive than his goal involvement record                                                                                               Pogba's distance and defensive stats are far less impressive than his goal involvement record                                   Will United miss him? Pogba's talent is not in question. The major concern surrounds consistency. Jose Mourinho wanted his energy in attacking areas to be matched in the defensive third, and though Solskjaer's loosening of those shackles early on saw a huge improvement in form, Pogba struggled again in the latter months of the 2018/19 season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1:42                                                                      Transfer Target: Paul Pogba We take a look at Paul Pogba's best moments in a Manchester United shirt from the Premier League amid speculation he could be leaving Old Trafford.

United will no doubt be planning ahead for all eventualities - a reactive approach to a Pogba sale would leave little time given the window closes on August 8. Reports suggest United have made enquiries for Youri Tielemans , impressive on loan at Leicester from Monaco last season, a move which would cost around £35m, but West Ham have told United they have no intention of selling Declan Rice  this summer. United have also been heavily linked with Real Betis' Giovani Lo Celso , valued at £67m, Newcastle's Sean Longstaff , though no approach has been made , and more loosely linked with Ajax's Donny van de Beek  and Sporting Lisbon's Bruno Fernandes.

Oddball 6d   Despite the focus on developing more techinically gifted players, the gap between u21s and senior football remains abit wide. However, the focus on developing more techincally gifted players from the younger underage groups, is helping to close the gap to playing senior football. Majority of players from yester years, who excelled at youth level often found it difficult to replicate that level of excellence at senior level, because they were unprepared and lacked the techincal ability to excel at the top level. Thus, the focus on developing more techincally gifted players from the younger underage groups is certainly a step in the right direction, which should benefit the senior team in years to come.     Gareth Bale no longer a Manchester United transfer target       Oddball 14 Jun   Bale could have signed for Utd before he made his move to Madrid. If that had been the case, it's hughly unlikely Utd will now be desperately trying to force him out of the door, as Madrid are doing with him right now. But, guessing the lure of playing for Madrid was too much to resist so here we are. Utd might not have room to accomodate bale, however, it's lunatic and bordering on insanity to suggest he can't boost utd's chances of at least competing for top 4 next season (if he stays healthy) should he put pen to paper. Tbh, Utd should be doing everything possible to sign bale, if Madrid are willing to go close to halves on the player as per his huge wages, cos his recent injury record indicates it's a very risky deal if not. As it stands, bale's best option is a loan deal, but I suspect Madrid don't want to subsidise his wages. Hence, the lack of interest from Utd and other top clubs. Not dissimilar to the situation, Utd have got themselves into with Sanchez. However, unlike Sanchez, bale has at least proved his worth to Madrid, something that Sanchez is yet to acheive at Utd.     Manchester United's transfer policy: A quick fix or time to rebuild?       Oddball 11 Jun   Utd have tried signing ready made players and look where it has left them. Fact is there is no right or wrong way to achieving success, as long as there is a structure behind what they want to acheive. Signing a bunch of young players with sprinkles of experienced players appears to be the way forward. However, only time will tell if this is the case.     Manchester United make Ivan Rakitic contact: European Paper Talk       Oddball 12 Jun   Rakitic to utd will be really nice if it comes off. But, knowing how utd conduct their transfer business under Woodward, it's very unlikely he will join Utd, not unless Barca really want him gone which I very much doubt. But, with talk of pogba leaving Utd need to sign a big name in midfield and by all accounts rakitic very much fits the bill.     Aaron Wan-Bissaka favours Manchester United move       Oddball 13 Jun   The good thing is the player wants to come to Old Trafford, so if Utd really want to sign him then they should get it sorted. By all accounts, he fits the bill, but utd have obviously lost their ability to conduct transfer business swiftly and now do so at snail pace. No thanks to Woodward, and his lack of experience at conducting such matters with a sense of urgency. The million dollar question is, where is the dof? Cos Utd do need one asap!     Jose Mourinho favours international management over club role       Oddball 3d   Is Jose still one of the top managers around? Ofcourse, because his record speaks for itself. Thus, by all accounts jose can still do a decent job at club level, and if he decides to become the manager of a country then good luck to him. However, there aren't a lot of top clubs or nations out there looking for managers so it might be a bit tricky for jose to get what he desires. Nonetheless, a manager with his credentials will always be highly regarded amongst those in the know. The only question is, how much recent percieved failures both at Chelsea and at Utd have taken out of him? Fact is, if jose gets his mojo back there ain't alot of better managers around. Just look at his past records and acheivements if in doubt.     Gareth Bale should leave Real Madrid on loan, says Ramon Calderon       Oddball 13 Jun   Madrid are doing everything humanly possible to get bale off their books. The problem is, bale is on a huge contract and even with a loan deal, Madrid would still have to pay considerable sums towards his upkeep so as to generate more traffic and get other clubs interested. But, it's clear Madrid just want to reduce their their wage bill anyway they can, and this is now sounding like an SOS call. However, this is madrid we talking about right? Nonetheless, Madrid's situation is partly understandable, afterall, they just made a huge investment on hazard, and they certainly intend to recoup some of the monies spent anyway possible. However, as long as bale is prepared to warm the bench for an extended period of time, he holds all the aces, cos he can just sit tight, collect the doe and see if anything worthwhile comes along.     Juventus hold Paul Pogba talks with Man Utd in London       James Mac 13 Jun   Getting shut of Pogba is good news but scratching around the likes of Swansea and Crystal Palace clearly highlights the depths of our financial problems. We need to be competing for proven world class players if we are going to climb out of this mess but it doesn’t look good.     Manchester City and Liverpool handed contrasting run-ins to 2019/20 Premier League season       Juno Sibbz 14 Jun   Lol they're still gonna play the same teams as everybody else relax     Christian Eriksen: Spurs would face tough task to replace playmaker       Juno Sibbz 12 Jun   I thought the Premier League is on the up but our clubs still cant hold onto their best players and it's even more precarious for Spurs who are arguably the 6th biggest club [not based on facts] in there right now it could prove a very tricky situation holding onto Kane, Dele & Eriksen     Kylian Mbappe and Trent Alexander-Arnold among world's most valuable players, says study         theonetruth 13 Jun   If Harry Kane is worth 150m I have Fallopian tubes     Paul Pogba expected to stay at Manchester United       Oddball 5d   Pogba and utd not looking like a match made in heaven. Fact is, he is good but not as good as he thinks. If the price is right, utd will be wise to cut him loose. Afterall, he left before and he can always do so again. No one player should be bigger than the club. Some players have a positive influence on the team, but looking at pogba, it is difficult not to think he has a negative influence on the team.On a side note, I see the uber super fake plastic joker on here is still corresponding with themselves through their alt accounts and various other aliases, which is so very funny to behold but no less demeaning. I'm sure those in the know, know whom I'm referring to. The question needs to be asked, who put you together? Smh!     England U21s: What's gone wrong for Aidy Boothroyd's talented group of young players?       Oddball 2h   England had a relatively strong team in this competition, however player attitudes, team selections and tactics appear to have cost them highly. In the end the manager needs to shoulder the blame for their disappointed exit. But, quotes like they will have to carry me out clearly shows he doesn't think he is completely responsible for the  team's failures. Nonetheless, the players have to look at themselves as well. The likes of Madison, Harvey, Gray and co failed to perform, whilst lack of concentration or poor positioning appears to have contributed to the players individual mistakes. More often than not when players make individual mistakes it is because they have a poor attitude to training, lack of concentration or focus during games or poor positioning. Overall blame should rest on the manager, because he selected the players. Hence, Aidy Boothroyd should be considering his position, rather than saying he will be staying put, when the team has obviously failed to acheive it's objectives.     Alexis Sanchez scores for Chile but is time up at Manchester United?       Oddball 3d   Sanchez may be able to get back to something close to his previous performance levels, but he will have to work his socks off to make it happen. So, the more pressing question is not whether he can find his form again, but whether he can find the motivation to propel him to find his form again? Fact is, after being a top player for such a long time, it's difficult to not imagine that his confidence has taken a huge hit due to his poor performance in a Utd shirt. However, watching Sanchez playing for Chile it was difficult not to imagine he can still offer Utd something different in attack, but it's also difficult to not imagine if what he still has to offer is good enough for Utd in their quest to return to the top table. His goal against the japs was a beauty to behold, a diving header from the left that went to the top left corner which left the keeper with no chance. However, it would take alot more from Sanchez to convince folks he still has the ability, hunger and focus to shine for Utd, and as in everything else the clock is ticking.
