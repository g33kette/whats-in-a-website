  Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson made an unfortunate blunder as England U21s exited the European Championships last night.   Drawing 2-2 and needing a win to keep qualification hopes alive, Henderson  let a long range effort through his fingers before another strike consigned the Young Lions to a 4-2 defeat. After the game, Henderson said: “I took my eye off the ball for a split second, it went under. You learn from it. It won’t change me as a person. I know where I am going. I won’t let it affect me.”    United  target Aaron Wan-Bissaka  was an unused substitute in the game after his own goal in the opening defeat to France.    Meanwhile, reports in Italy say United midfielder Paul Pogba  has contacted Juventus manager Maurizio Sarri, asking him to take him back to the club.    We'll bring you all the latest United news and transfer rumours throughout the day.    19:14   What new goalkeeping coach means for Alvarez With United hiring a new goalkeeping coach, it could have knock-on implications for Emilio Alvarez.      Lukaku future hinges on Icardi transfer - report Inter Milan must sell Mauro Icardi to stand any chance of financing a deal to sign Romelu Lukaku. The Guardian   say Icardi is happy to leave Inter and Antonio Conte is happy to let him leave, but there are few clubs who would be willing to pay Inter’s £60million asking price for the Argentine forward. Juventus are said to be the only club to have registered an interest in signing Icardi this summer.       18:56   Stoney sums up VAR issues The Women’s World Cup has highlighted a few issues with VAR this summer, and United Women manager Casey Stoney sums up the situation perfectly.    18:29   United 'told asking price' for defender Apparently United are among the clubs interested in Armando Izzo. Tuttosport  claim Torini want €30m for the 27-year-old.  Manager of Manchester United Ole Gunnar Solskjaer    (Image: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)     18:18   United make new coaching appointment - full story Manchester United have appointed Richard Hartis as goalkeeping coach, to work alongside current incumbent Emilio Alvarez. Hartis spent a decade as head of academy goalkeeping at United from 2000 to 2010 and he worked with the first team during the 2007/08 season, when the club won the Premier League and the Champions League. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has usually taken Hartis with him during his managerial career. Having worked together when the Norwegian was in charge of United’s reserves, Hartis followed Solskjaer to Molde and then to Cardiff City.

Pogba, of course, is looking for a ‘new challenge’. While United have no intention of selling.

Wilson was released by United last month, but could be headed back to Aberdeen where he spent time on loan. Dons boss Derek McInnes said: “James is a player, while I’d have liked to have worked for him longer, who has things to consider. He’s been on holiday and there is nothing imminent on that.  “When you look at his contribution in the last few games, he set up two goals against Hearts and he could have had a hat-trick against Celtic and I don’t mind people missing chances as long as they get in there and he was a threat.”    “He was lively in the game and he scored the winning goal in the last game of the season at Easter Road. He was very good in the second half and there was an indication that maybe the season finished too early for James. “We will keep dialogue open.”    James Wilson celebrates scoring against Hull on his debut    (Image: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)     16:41   Maguire drops huge transfer hint Manchester United fans think Harry Maguire could be bound for Old Trafford after the England defender liked a comment on Instagram.  The comment in question said Maguire would be a fan favourite at United if he signed. Read the full story here.        16:21   Boothroyd slammed for Wan-Bissaka decision Aidy Boothroyd has been criticised for dropping Aaron Wan-Bissaka for England under-21s’ defeat by Romania yesterday. “I hated the decision on Wan-Bissaka, I thought it was terrible,” Tony Cascarino told talkSPORT.     “You want trust from your team, you want your players to trust that the manager is going to back you.   “He [Wan-Bissaka] has made a mistake, one mistake in a game, if he’s your number one right-back, you play him again.   “All this talk of Manchester United and having his head turned, [it’s] nonsense.   “He made a mistake in a game, back him, tell him he’s still going to be number one. I think there were loads and loads of issues over the course of the two games.”    Aaron Wan-Bissaka's own goal condemned England Under-21s to defeat against France    (Image: PA)     15:42   Dembele pledges future to Lyon It was reported earlier in the transfer window that United had lodged a bid for Moussa Dembele but the French striker last night pledged his immediate future to Lyon.  “I still have 4 years left on my contract, I will be in Lyon next season.”    LYON, FRANCE - FEBRUARY 19: Moussa Dembele of Olympique Lyon looks on during the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 First Leg match between Olympique Lyonnais and FC Barcelona at Groupama Stadium on February 19, 2019 in Lyon, France.

PSG remain keen but their situation is complicated by the uncertainty surrounding Neymar’s future and the French champions may prioritise sorting that situation out ahead of signing De Ligt. Barcelona are also said to still be in the frame, while United aren’t even mentioned as a possible destination for the Ajax captain. It was the MEN’s  understanding at the end of May that United didn’t expect to sign De Ligt.       14:58   Mourinho enjoying the tennis United’s former manager is at Queen’s Club this afternoon.

This Calciomercato   report says Juventus and Manchester City are in the running to sign Isco. The MEN understands City are not interested in Isco and have not been since he snubbed them to join Madrid in 2013.  Real Madrid's Isco    (Image: David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)     13:51   United 'on the verge of agreeing Wan-Bissaka fee' United are on the verge of agreeing a fee for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Mail Online   say United held extensive talks with Palace on Friday with a deal worth £42.5million plus add-on close to being agreed.

Taken from Martial's Instagram story     13:02   United haven't made approach for Genk full-back - journalist The sooner Wan-Bissaka is signed up, the better.    12:51   Klopp stands by old comments on Pogba Jurgen Klopp has said he sticks by comments he made when Manchester United signed Paul Pogba in 2016.  Speaking after United  secured Pogba’s  return from Juventus three years ago, Klopp said he would walk away from management if it became the norm for clubs to regularly spend big sums of money on individual players in the transfer market.  “If you bring one player in for £100million and he gets injured, then it all goes through the chimney,” Klopp said after United secured Pogba’s return three years ago. “The day that this is football, I’m not in a job anymore, because the game is about playing together.”  Since making those comments Liverpool  have signed Fabinho for £40million, Naby Keita for £54million, Alisson for £66million and Virgil van Dijk for £75million. When Klopp was asked in an interview with German TV if his opinion on transfer fees have changed now Liverpool are spending big money with regularity, this is what he said.         12:26   Former Inter player believes Lukaku's time at United is up Former Inter player Andy van der Meyde has said he believes Romelu Lukaku’s time at United is up. “I think this time in England is over and he can move to another like Serie A,” Van der Meyde told FCInterNews.it.    “Romelu’s message to one of your [Italian] TV stations in which he praised Conte by claiming that he is the best manager in the world, makes it clear.    “But to avoid specific problems, again this is just my personal opinion.”         12:01   Henderson's defiant message after England mistake Dean Henderson’s confidence wasn’t knocked by his mistake for England’s under-21s last night. “You can go from hero to zero as quick as that,” he said after the match.  “I am looking where I can do even before I have even caught it.   “I took my eye off the ball for a split second, it went under. You learn from it. You can pull up trees about it but I’m not going to do that. I know why I did it. These things happen.   “Going forward you just learn, but unfortunately they are things that go out there and people will question but it won’t change me as a person. I know where I am going. I won’t let it affect me.”         11:51   Solskjaer 'tells United to sell Pogba' So far this summer United’s stance on Paul Pogba remains the same. The France international is clearly keen to get out but the club believe he will be at Old Trafford next season and are not interested in selling. However, a report in the Daily Star  claims Solskjaer wants Pogba gone and has told club chiefs to sell the unsettled star to the highest bidder. The report adds that the United manager is desperate to sell the World Cup winner to raise funds for new signings after being told he has just £100m to spend before the start of next season.   Paul Pogba of Manchester United.      11:31   Higginbotham urges United to keep Pogba and De Gea Former United player Danny Higginbotham believes the club be should do its utmost to keep hold of David de Gea and Paul Pogba this summer. “I think with De Gea, they need to be doing everything to try to keep him at the club. Lukaku, I think from Solskjaer’s perspective he’ll look at it and think ‘where does he fit into the system that I want to play?’   “Paul Pogba, I know a lot of people have given him a lot of negativity during the season and after what he came out and said last weekend but if you can get him to stay at Manchester United and be happy, he would be the type of player I would build the team around.   “But you have to have the players around him to allow him to go and express himself.”    Paul Pogba and David De Gea.      11:15   Neymar and Koulibaly latest Kalidou Koulibaly was a target for United under Jose Mourinho but talk of him moving to United has gone quiet in recent months. And it’s now being reported by Italian outlet Tuttosport  that Manchester City and Juventus will go head to head to sign the Napoli centre-back. Meanwhile, it always seemed unlikely that United would be able to tempt Neymar to Manchester, despite this Sport   report listing Old Trafford as a possible destination for the Brazilian earlier this month, and it’s been reported in Sport  today that Barcelona are willing to pay PSG €100million plus Philippe Coutinho to seal Neymar’s return to the Nou Camp.   10:47   Hummels 'rejected United in favour of Dortmund return' It’s been reported by German outlet Bild  that Mats Hummels rejected a move to United this summer in favour of returning to Borussia Dortmund. United reportedly offered Hummels more money than he will get at Dortmund but the defender chose to go back to his old club because he wants to play in the Champions League next season.   10:20   United fan ends myth about Vidic and Torres That’s the end of that, then.    09:56   Chile manager explains Sanchez's return to form Chile manager Reinaldo Rueda suggested United are to blame for Alexis Sanchez’s drop in form after the forward scored for the second game in succession at the Copa America. “He has the motivation, affection and some relationships that he has in the national team and maybe he didn’t have them in Manchester,” Rueda said after Chile’s victory over Ecuador.    “He arrived at a difficult, inopportune moment, perhaps in the most unbalanced United in recent years.”     09:38   United 'ready to increase De Gea contract offer' United are reportedly ready to offer David de Gea £350,000 a week in a bid to keep the Spanish goalkeeper at Old Trafford. The Sun   say the deal will be a four-year one until 2023 with the option for the club to extend it by a further year. United had previously offered De Gea £300,000 a week and that offer had been on the table for several months, but the 28-year-old had turned his nose up at that as he eyed a salary closer to that of top earner Alexis Sanchez. The report adds that United are confident De Gea will stay at the club on the improved terms.  David de Gea on international duty      09:24   Juventus 'expect to sign De Ligt' Italian champions Juventus expect to win the race to sign Matthijs de Ligt, according to reports. It is claimed by Dutch outlet De Telegraaf   that they are willing to pay Ajax €70million for the 19-year-old and give the teenager a five-year contract worth between €15m and €20m per year.     (Image: Getty Images)     09:21   Sanchez scores again for Chile Alexis Sanchez made it two goals in two games at the Copa America overnight as he netted Chile’s winner against Ecuador to send them into the quarter-finals. Sanchez completed the match despite suffering with an ankle injury. “I think I have a sprain, I hope it’s not too serious,” he said afterwards.  “At half-time they strapped it up, I played on with a bit of pain.”           Man United tipped to complete these seven transfer deals this summer After missing out on a Champions League place and stuttering towards the finish line at the end of last season, Manchester United are looking to bolster their squad and get back to the top of the Premier League table. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has stated his intent to make much-needed improvements to the quality of his side - with United being linked to a whole host of big names that could help make the Norwegian’s first full season in charge a memorable one. The latest transfer odds have pinpointed which players out of an array of links look the most likely to move to Old Trafford. Read the full story here.
