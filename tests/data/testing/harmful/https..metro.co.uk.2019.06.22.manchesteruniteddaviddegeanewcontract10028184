 David de Gea set for Man Utd U-turn after massive new contract offer 
 
The Spaniard has been offered fresh terms amid interest from PSG (Picture: Getty)  Manchester United  are growing increasingly confident that David de Gea can be persuaded to remain at Old Trafford after reportedly offering fresh terms to the goalkeeper. 
De Gea only has one year left to run on his current deal and rejected United’s take-it-or-leave-it final offer of £300,000-a-week, with the Spaniard believing he is entitled to a salary on par with the club’s highest earner Alexis Sanchez . 
United had been unwilling to budge on their offer, leading to speculation that they could cash in on De Gea rather than risk losing him for nothing next year.

 Manchester United return to negotiating table to get David de Gea to stay 
 
De Gea now appears to be behind Kepa in Spain’s pecking order after a bad season (Picture: EPA)  But now The Sun  report that De Gea is set to stay at United after they returned to the negotiating table with a £350,000-a-week offer more in line with his demands.

   That represents almost double his current salary and would be a four-year deal, with the option for a fifth – a clause that has become common place at United.

However, the 28-year-old may delay a decision until after the transfer window to see how much ambition United show in the window and what signings they end up with.

 Man Utd on verge of huge breakthrough in David de Gea talks after new offer 
 
The Spaniard made several uncharacteristic errors during the 2018/19 season (Picture: Reuters)  De Gea had a relatively below-par season by his usual standards and appears to have lost his place as Spain’s No.1 goalkeeper to Chelsea shot-stopper Kepa Arrizabalaga. 
The Sun ’s report claims that his gaffe-prone season has actually put off both PSG and Real Madrid from signing him, with United still likely to demand a fee in excess of £75million despite only having one year left on his deal, and reinforced the chances of him staying at Old Trafford.
