                POLL: Who should Andy Murray play mixed doubles with at Wimbledon? 
                   
               
            
             
           
        
        
            The long-awaited wait finally ended for Andy Murray , as the former world No. 1 kicked off his comeback on Thursday by winning his doubles debut with Feliciano Lopez  at Queen's Club. These are the Top 5 photos from Murray's magnificent return.  
1. Many, including Murray, thought his career could be cut short in January due to an unbearable right hip injury. Having already undergone a procedure previously, he decided to opt for a hip resurfacing to improve his quality of life, with playing tennis no longer his main priority. After several positive signs throughout the recovery process, the 32-year-old made his return on the doubles court at Queen's Club with partner Feliciano Lopez.   
  
2. The three-time Grand Slam singles champion moved well and seemed to be playing free of pain. Murray and Lopez took on top-seeded  Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah, who were fresh off a Roland Garros semifinal run.    
  
3. Murray decided to play doubles at Queen's Club to test his physical condition in a slightly less intensive doubles environment. It's expected this will help better gauge if a return to the singles court later this season is possible.    Error     OK                                               Error     OK                
  
4. The Scot, known for his exceptional hands and feel, was comfortable transitioning from the baseline. He ignited the home crowd with his passionate performance.   
  
5. Murray and Lopez held their ground to upset the No. 1 seeds, 7-6 (5), 6-3. Murray’s return brought his home crowd to their feet as they cheered and celebrated a personal victory that goes far beyond the outcome of Thursday’s match.  
  
Bonus: Watch below to see how Murray and Lopez clinched their first win together.
