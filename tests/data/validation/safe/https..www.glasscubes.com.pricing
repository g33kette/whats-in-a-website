                        Questions? 
                        We are here to help, so please ask 
                     
                    
                          No credit card required  As a part of the sign up process we ask for some basic information, including your name and email address. We will never ask for your credit card details until you are ready to upgrade to a paid account. Try Glasscubes with no obligation to purchase. 
                          Accepted methods of payment  We accept all major credit and debit cards for payment. We can also accept PayPal or set up a Direct Debit for UK based businesses. If you wish to sign up for an Annual Subscription, we will invoice you on our receipt of your purchase order; please contact us to arrange this. 
                          How long is my contract?  You choose the length of your commitment when you upgrade to a paid account. Choose between a monthly or annual subscription. See our Terms of Service  for full details. If you would prefer a longer contract please contact us.  
                          Do you provide invoices/receipts?  Yes, you can view and download your invoices for tax and expenses purposes, in the Account section of the Admin Area in your account. 
                          I would like to sign up for a long period of time  You can choose the billing period when you upgrade your account and enter your credit card details for the first time. If you decide that you want to move from a monthly to an annual subscription, simply contact us to arrange it. 
                          How do I get everything out of my account?  If you are thinking of closing your account or just want a copy of everything, we provide a backup tool so that you can download all of your files, whenever you want. 
                          Are you a charity or not for profit organisation?  We like to help out charities and “not for profits” as much as we can - we have many charities already using Glasscubes. Please contact us for special rates and setup. 
                          What if I want a feature which isn't listed?  We listen to our users and welcome their feedback. So, if there’s something that you want included in Glasscubes, please visit our user feedback forum and we’ll act as quickly as possible to get the feature implemented for you. 
                          How safe is my data, contacts and files?  Glasscubes has 2048bit encryption over a SSL connection to ensure that your site cannot be hacked. Rest assured that everything within your Glasscubes account is safe.
