            United tabled an £85m offer for Koulibaly last week but that was rejected by the Serie A outfit before they also turned down a £90m offer from Real Madrid as they look to keep their star defender.  With Napoli holding firm, the Red Devils have now turned their attentions to signing Benfica defender Ruben Dias. Signing Dias would be a much cheaper alternative and would fit in with Solskjaer's transfer strategy of buying younger players.     Napoli are playing hardball with United over a move for star defender Kalidou Koulibaly  +3

   Napoli are playing hardball with United over a move for star defender Kalidou Koulibaly   The Benfica centre-back is only 22 years of age - five years younger than Koulibaly - and would cost a considerable amount less. It is reported that Benfica are willing to let Dias leave this summer if they receive a fee around £60m. United have also shown interest in Ajax wonderkid Matthijs de Ligt after guiding the Eredivisie side to the Champions League semi-finals. But they face fierce competition from the likes of Barcelona and Liverpool this summer for his signature.     Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is looking to revamp his United squad ahead of the new campaign  +3
