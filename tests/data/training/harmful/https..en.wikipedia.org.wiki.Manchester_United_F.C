 Early years (1878–1945)  
Main article: History of Manchester United F.C. (1878–1945) History of Manchester United F.C. (1878–1945)  
Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway  (LYR) depot at Newton Heath Newton Heath .[17]   The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers Bolton Wanderers F.C. ' reserve team.[18]   By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination The Combination , a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance Football Alliance , which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division Football League First Division , by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name.[17]   After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division Football League Second Division .[17]

Enlarge  The Manchester United team at the start of the 1905–06 season 1905–06 Manchester United F.C. season , in which they were runners-up in the Second Division   
In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £280,000 in 2019[nb 1]   – the club was served with a winding-up order Liquidation .[19]   Captain Harry Stafford Harry Stafford  found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies John Henry Davies  (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[20]   on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[21]  [nb 2]   Under Ernest Mangnall Ernest Mangnall , who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield FA Community Shield [22]   and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City Manchester City F.C. .[23]  
 In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club Yo-yo club , achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson James W. Gibson , who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club.[24]   In the 1938–39 season 1938–39 Manchester United F.C. season , the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[24]

In October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby Matt Busby , who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[25]   Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948 1948 FA Cup Final . In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[26]   They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.[27]   In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea Chelsea F.C.  the same opportunity the previous season.[28]   En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid Real Madrid C.F. , the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht R.S.C. Anderlecht , which remains the club's biggest victory on record.[29]

Assistant manager Jimmy Murphy Jimmy Murphy (footballer)  took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final 1958 FA Cup Final , which they lost to Bolton Wanderers Bolton Wanderers F.C. . In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA UEFA  invited the club to compete in the 1958–59 European Cup 1958–59 European Cup  alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. . Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[32]  [33]   Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law Denis Law  and Pat Crerand Pat Crerand , who combined with the next generation of youth players – including George Best George Best  – to win the FA Cup in 1963 1963 FA Cup Final . The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica S.L. Benfica  4–1 in the final 1968 European Cup Final [34]   with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year Ballon d'Or (1956–2009) : Bobby Charlton Bobby Charlton , Denis Law and George Best.[35]   They then represented Europe in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup 1968 Intercontinental Cup  against Estudiantes of Argentina, but lost the tie after losing the first leg in Buenos Aires, before a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness Wilf McGuinness .[36]

Following an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season 1969–70 Manchester United F.C. season  and a poor start to the 1970–71 season 1970–71 Manchester United F.C. season , Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell Frank O'Farrell  was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty Tommy Docherty  in December 1972.[38]   Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[34]   The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976 1976 FA Cup Final , but were beaten by Southampton Southampton F.C. . They reached the final again in 1977 1977 FA Cup Final , beating Liverpool Liverpool F.C.  2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.[36]  [39]  
 Dave Sexton Dave Sexton  replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan Joe Jordan (footballer) , Gordon McQueen Gordon McQueen , Gary Bailey Gary Bailey , and Ray Wilkins Ray Wilkins , the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal Arsenal F.C.  in the 1979 FA Cup Final 1979 FA Cup Final . Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[40]   He was replaced by Ron Atkinson Ron Atkinson , who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson Bryan Robson  from West Bromwich Albion West Bromwich Albion F.C. . Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years – in 1983 1983 FA Cup Final  and 1985 1985 FA Cup Final . In 1985–86 1985–86 Manchester United F.C. season , after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[41]

Alex Ferguson Alex Ferguson  and his assistant Archie Knox Archie Knox  arrived from Aberdeen Aberdeen F.C.  on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[42]   and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[43]   Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88 1987–88 Manchester United F.C. season , the club was back in 11th place the following season.[44]   Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace Crystal Palace F.C.  in the 1990 FA Cup Final 1990 FA Cup Final  replay (after a 3–3 draw) saved Ferguson's career.[45]  [46]   The following season, Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners' Cup UEFA Cup Winners' Cup  title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup 1991 European Super Cup , beating European Cup 1990–91 European Cup  holders Red Star Belgrade Red Star Belgrade  1–0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1–0 at Wembley.[41]   In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first \"Double Double (association football) \" in the club's history.[41]   United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96,[47]   before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare.[48]

 Manchester United won the league again in the 1999–2000 1999–2000 FA Premier League  and 2000–01 2000–01 FA Premier League  seasons. The team finished third in 2001–02 2001–02 FA Premier League , before regaining the title in 2002–03 2002–03 FA Premier League .[54]   They won the 2003–04 FA Cup 2004 FA Cup Final , beating Millwall Millwall F.C.  3–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium Millennium Stadium  in Cardiff Cardiff  to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[55]   In the 2005–06 season 2005–06 Manchester United F.C. season , Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[56]   but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic Wigan Athletic F.C.  in the 2006 Football League Cup Final 2006 Football League Cup Final .

 2013–present  
On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[64]  [65]   The club announced the next day that Everton Everton F.C.  manager David Moyes David Moyes  would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[66]  [67]  [68]   Ryan Giggs Ryan Giggs  took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League UEFA Champions League  for the first time since 1995–96.[69]   They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn't qualified for a European competition since 1990.[70]   On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal Louis van Gaal  would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[71]   Malcolm Glazer Malcolm Glazer , the patriarch of the Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[72]  
 Although Van Gaal's first season saw United once again qualify for the Champions League through a fourth-place finish in the Premier League, his second season saw United go out of the same tournament in the group stage.[73]   United also fell behind in the title race for the third consecutive season, finishing in 5th place, in spite of several expensive signings during Van Gaal's tenure. However, that same season, Manchester United won the FA Cup FA Cup  for a 12th time, this being their first trophy won since 2013.[74]   Despite this victory, Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later,[75]   with José Mourinho José Mourinho  appointed in his place on 27 May, signing a three-year contract.[76]   That season, United finished in sixth place while winning the EFL Cup 2016–17 EFL Cup  for the fifth time and the Europa League 2016–17 UEFA Europa League  for the first time, as well as the FA Community Shield FA Community Shield  for a record 21st time in Mourinho's first competitive match in charge.[77]   Despite not finishing in the top four, United qualified for the Champions League UEFA Champions League  through their Europa League win. Wayne Rooney Wayne Rooney  scored his 250th goal with United, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time top scorer, before leaving the club at the end of the season to return to Everton.

Enlarge  Manchester United badge in the 1960s   
The club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms Manchester City Council , although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[81]   The devil stems from the club's nickname \"The Red Devils\"; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971.[81]  
 Newton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'.[82]   A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers Knickerbockers (clothing) .[83]   Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys[83]   which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[83]  
 After the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[83]   Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \"V\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup Final 1909 FA Cup Final . They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[83]   For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[83]   The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and/or white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018–19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit.[84]   Since 1997–98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility.[85]   The current home kit is a red shirt with the trademark Adidas three stripes Three stripes  in red on the shoulders, white shorts, and black socks.[86]  
 The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999–2000 season,[87]   and the 2011–12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[88]   An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995–96 season was dropped after just five games, most notoriously against Southampton where Alex Ferguson forced the team to change into the third kit during half-time of its final outing. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit.[89]   In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \"Manchester United\", a reversible white/gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[90]  
 The club's third kit is often all-blue, this was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season.[91]   Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–06.[92]   From 2006–07 to 2013–14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11, apart from 2008–09 when an all-blue kit was launch to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967–68 European Cup 1967–68 European Cup  success.[93]

Grounds  
 A stand of a football stadium. The seats are red, and the words \"Manchester United\" are written in white seats. The roof of the stand is supported by a cantilever structure. On the lip of the roof, it reads \"Old Trafford Manchester\".  United's current ground, Old Trafford, after its expansion in 2006.

 1878–1893: North Road  
Main article: North Road (football ground) North Road (football ground)  
Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road North Road (football ground) , close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[94]   Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[95]   Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland Sunderland A.F.C.  on 4 March 1893.[96]   A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[97]  
 
 1893–1910: Bank Street Ground  
Main article: Bank Street (football ground) Bank Street (football ground)  
In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut A. H. Albut  procured the use of the Bank Street ground Bank Street (football ground)  in Clayton Clayton, Greater Manchester .[98]   It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893–94 season 1893–94 Newton Heath F.C. season , two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\". At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\".[98]   Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley Burnley F.C.  on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman Alf Farman  score a hat-trick Hat-trick , Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest Nottingham Forest F.C.  three weeks later.[98]   In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers Broughton Rangers  rugby league Rugby league  club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[99]  
 When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey Harpurhey  for the next reserves game against Padiham.[100]   Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[101]   Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[101]  
 
 1910–present: Old Trafford  
Main article: Old Trafford Old Trafford  
Following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;[101]   in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford Old Trafford  was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch Archibald Leitch  was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup FA Cup  semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.  and Grimsby Town Grimsby Town F.C.  drew 76,962 spectators.[102]  
 Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission War Damage Commission  in the amount of £22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \"home\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road Maine Road  ground; Manchester United was charged £5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[103]   Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered Cantilever  structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993–94 season 1993–94 Manchester United F.C. season .[36]   First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £40,000, four 180-foot (55 m) pylons were erected, each housing 54 individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[104]  
 The Taylor Report Taylor Report 's requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[105]   The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers Blackburn Rovers F.C.  4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[106]   In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[107]  [108]   Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund Borussia Dortmund .[109]  [110]  [111]  
 
Support  
Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe.[112]   The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[113]   The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte Deloitte  estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide,[15]   while other estimates put this figure closer to 333 million.[114]   The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona FC Barcelona  and Real Madrid Real Madrid C.F. ), with over 71 million Facebook fans as of September 2016.[16]  [115]   A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[116]  
 Supporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association  (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[117]   and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust Manchester United Supporters' Trust  (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester F.C. United of Manchester . The West Stand of Old Trafford – the \"Stretford End Stretford End \" – is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.[118]  
 
Rivalries  
Main articles: Manchester derby Manchester derby , Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry , Leeds United F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry Leeds United F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry , and Arsenal F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry Arsenal F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry  
Manchester United has rivalries with Arsenal Arsenal F.C. , Leeds United Leeds United A.F.C. , Liverpool Liverpool F.C. , and Manchester City Manchester City F.C. , against whom they contest the Manchester derby Manchester derby .[119]  [120]  
 The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution Industrial Revolution  when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool Liverpool  was a major port.[121]   The two clubs are the most successful English teams in both domestic and European competitions; and between them they have won 38 league titles List of English football champions , 9 European Cups UEFA Champions League , 4 UEFA Cups UEFA Europa League , 4 UEFA Super Cups UEFA Super Cup , 19 FA Cups FA Cup , 13 League Cups EFL Cup , 1 FIFA Club World Cup FIFA Club World Cup , 1 Intercontinental Cup Intercontinental Cup (football)  and 36 FA Community Shields FA Community Shield .[5]  [122]  [123]   It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalries in the association football world and is considered the most famous fixture in English football.[124]  [125]  [126]  [127]  [128]  
 The \"Roses Rivalry\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses Wars of the Roses , fought between the House of Lancaster House of Lancaster  and the House of York House of York , with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[129]  
 The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers Alex Ferguson Alex Ferguson  and Arsène Wenger Arsène Wenger , have battled for the Premier League Premier League  title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.[130]  [131]  
 
Global brand  
     Enlarge  Aeroflot Aeroflot  is an official carrier of the club.   
Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance Brand Finance , valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year, valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[132]   In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes Forbes   magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion.[133]   The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[134]   In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion. Forbes Magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion – $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[135]   They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion.[136]  
 The core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[118]   The \"iconic\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \"catenaccio Catenaccio \" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\".[137]   Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \"Fifth Beatle Fifth Beatle \" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[137]  
 As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[138]   The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure.[139]   During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.[140]  
 Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB BSkyB  broadcasting deal.[141]   Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51 million, compared to £42.5 million at Chelsea, £39.3 million at Liverpool, £34 million at Arsenal and £27.9 million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike Nike, Inc. , who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.[142]   Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV MUTV (Manchester United F.C.)  – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[15]

In an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, Sharp Electronics Sharp Corporation  became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when Vodafone Vodafone  agreed a four-year, £30 million deal.[143]   Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[143]  
 To commence at the start of the 2006–07 season, American insurance corporation AIG American International Group  agreed a four-year £56.5 million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[144]  [145]   At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, American reinsurance company Aon Aon plc  became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately £80 million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[146]   Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL DHL Express  reported to be worth £40 million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[147]  [148]   The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner.[149]   The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth £180 million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre Trafford Training Centre .[150]  
 The club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro Umbro , until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear Admiral Sportswear  in 1975.[151]   Adidas Adidas  received the contract in 1980,[152]   before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[153]   Umbro's sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike Nike, Inc. 's record-breaking £302.9 million deal that lasted until 2015; 3.8 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[154]  [155]   In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \"platinum\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser Budweiser .[156]  
 On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors General Motors , which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014–15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet Chevrolet .[157]  [158]   Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season, citing rising costs.[159]  [160]   Since the start of the 2015–16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of £750 million.[161]  [162]   Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler Kohler Co.  became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018–19 season.[163]  
 
Ownership and finances  
Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form.[20]   In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[20]   After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000.[24]   Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[164]   but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian,[165]   but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman Harold Hardman .[166]  
 Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54 per cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[167]   When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards Martin Edwards  went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.[168]   Media tycoon Robert Maxwell Robert Maxwell  attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.[168]   In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton Michael Knighton  for £20 million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.[168]  
 Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising £6.7 million),[169]   and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch Rupert Murdoch 's British Sky Broadcasting BSkyB  Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch  – now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust  – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover Hostile takeover . The Manchester United board accepted a £623 million offer,[170]   but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission Competition Commission (United Kingdom)  at the final hurdle in April 1999.[171]   A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier John Magnier  and J. P. McManus J. P. McManus , who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar Rock of Gibraltar (horse) , Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.[172]  
 In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer Malcolm Glazer  purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million (then approx. $1.5 billion).[173]   Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[174]   In July 2006, the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to £62 million a year.[175]  [176]   In January 2010, with debts of £716.5 million ($1.17 billion),[177]   Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504 million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509 million owed to international banks.[178]   The annual interest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45 million per annum.[179]   Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre Trafford Training Centre .[180]  [181]   Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \"Red Knights\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.[182]  
 In August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse Credit Suisse  in preparation for a $1 billion (approx. £600 million) initial public offering Initial public offering  (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange Singapore Exchange  that would value the club at more than £2 billion.[183]   However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange New York Stock Exchange  instead.[184]   Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook Facebook 's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3 billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[185]
