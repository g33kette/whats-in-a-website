\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst Prev  1 of 35 Next Last   3 hours ago June 18, 2019     Joe   Rangers have completed the signing of Sheyi Ojo from Liverpool.  
The 21-year-old, who spent last year in Ligue 1 with Stade de Reims, is a World Cup winner with England Under-20s and has represented the age groups throughout his career. 
Winger Ojo has also enjoyed spells in the Championship with Fulham, Wolves and Wigan.

   3 hours ago June 18, 2019     Joe   Rafael Benitez is 'considering' his Newcastle future.  
The Spaniard has been offered £12m-a-year to take over at Dalian Yifang and could swap St James Park for the Far East. 
The 59-year-old is out of contract at the end of the month and has so far rebuffed Mike Ashley's efforts to get him to sign a new deal. 
READ FULL STORY HERE.  
  
   4 hours ago June 18, 2019     Marc   Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata ‘has agreed a new contract’ at the club, according to reports.  
Mata's current deal will expire at the end of the month but the BBC claim he is all set to sign a one-year extension. 
The 31-year-old has been in talks since the end of the season and has always intended to stay despite reports of the contrary. 
 
  
   4 hours ago June 18, 2019     Marc   Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas admits Premier League targets Nabil Fekir and Tanguy Ndombele could leave the club this summer but no acceptable offers have been made yet.  
Fekir has long been linked with Liverpool while Tottenham are interested in Ndombele. 
Speaking to L'Equipe, Aulas said: “[Fekir’s] preference is shifting towards a move. We are open to discussions. 
“I have no news. We are waiting for offers in the coming days but for now, there is nothing. 
“Nothing is decided for Ndombele. We have lots of offers but they do not come up to the price we feel is right.” 
 
  
   5 hours ago June 18, 2019     Alex Varney    Birmingham City have parted company with manager Garry Monk.  
The Championship side announced on Tuesday evening that the decision was taken 'in the best interests of the club'. 
Assistant manager Pep Clotet has been placed in caretaker charge, while Sean Rush, Darryl Flahavan, Ryan Needs and James Beattie will remain on the coaching staff.

   6 hours ago June 18, 2019     Joseph   Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy is reportedly open to a move to Liverpool this summer.  
Jurgen Klopp is in the market for a new No.2 this summer, with Simon Mignolet set to leave and Loris Karius halfway through a two-season loan at Besiktas. 
The Reds have tracked McCarthy since before he joined the Saints from Crystal Palace in 2016. He was named their player of the year in 2017/18, but ended this season behind Angus Gunn in the pecking order. 
And, according to the Evening Standard  , Saints chiefs are willing to let the goalkeeper go this summer and the 31-year-old is keen to move to Liverpool. 
If a deal is done, McCarthy would become the seventh player since 2014 to make the move from St. Mary's to Anfield.  
  
   6 hours ago June 18, 2019     Joseph   Gareth Bale will NOT be leaving Real Madrid on loan this summer, according to his agent.  
Does this end the speculation surrounding the Welshman's future? 
Probably not. 

 
   
   7 hours ago June 18, 2019     Joseph   Juan Mata is poised to sign a new Manchester United contract.  
The Spaniard was strongly linked with leaving Old Trafford this summer when his contract expires. 
However, following the departure of Ander Herrera on a free transfer, the club are now keen to keep the 31-year-old. 
And, according to Sky Sports  , the club have held positive talks with Mata and now expect to announce his new contract soon. 
 
  
   7 hours ago June 18, 2019     Joseph   Real Madrid have been warned against signing Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.  
Former Los Blancos president Ramon Calderon believes bringing the World Cup winner to the Bernabeu would be ‘dangerous’ for team unity. 
“I think it is risky and dangerous, because he has proven his behaviour is not the best in some moments for a club like Real Madrid,” he told The Sun  . 
“He wants to be the protagonist many times, he is fighting with the coaches or sometimes with team-mates. That record is a bit dangerous in my opinion. 
“Players can change if the atmosphere is different and they find the right players and coach. In this case, it seems Zidane is keen on him and that could change his character.” 
 
  
   7 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   Josep Maria Bartomeu, the Barcelona president, claims the LaLiga champions have NOT made an offer for Antoine Griezmann.  
It is widely expected Griezmann will move to Camp Nou this summer having confirmed he will not remain at Atletico Madrid, but Bartomeu downplayed talk of a switch. 
“We've always said it, we've never spoken to him,” he said. “There's nothing.” 
  
   7 hours ago June 18, 2019     Joseph   Phil Jones could be frozen out at Manchester United this summer after he was offered to West Ham.  
The England defender was reportedly the mystery player included in United’s £45million bid to sign Hammers centre-back Issa Diop. 
But, according to The Sun  , West Ham immediately rejected the offer because they have no intention of selling Diop this summer, and have no interest in taking Jones. 
And it is claimed the move is an indication the 27-year-old is not in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s for the forthcoming season. 
 
   
   7 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   Burnley have rejected an offer from Besiktas to loan Ben Gibson for the 2019/20 season.  
The Turkish club hoped to sign the former Middlesbrough captain on a temporary basis with the option to buy him outright, but the Clarets turned down the bid. 
Gibson struggled in his debut season at Turf Moor as two separate hernia injuries kept him sidelined for much of the campaign. 
  
   8 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   Roberto Martinez, the Belgium manager, has discussed Yannick Carrasco's proposed move to Arsenal.  
The Gunners reportedly want to sign the winger, who currently players in the Chinese Super League, and Martinez was quizzed on the rumours by HLN . 
He said: “Yannick feels his moment has come. Who am I to stop him? 
“He doesn't necessarily have to leave China. I even plan a visit to the country, also to see [Mousa] Dembélé. Playing football in China is not an issue for me.” 
  
   9 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   Romelu Lukaku has 'officially' told Manchester United he wants to leave the club this summer.  
Gazzetta dello Sport claim Belgium forward Lukaku has made it clear his time at Old Trafford has come to an end after just two seasons with the Red Devils. 
Earlier this month it was claimed Lukaku has already agreed personal terms with Internazionale of Milan, where he will play under Antonio Conte, the former Chelsea manager who tried to sign him while in charge of the Blues. 
  
   9 hours ago June 18, 2019     Damian Mannion    Manchester City have moved closer to signing Rodri from Atletico Madrid.  
The 22-year-old central midfielder has reportedly informed the Spanish Liga club he wants to join the Premier League champions and City are expected to trigger the €70m release clause (£62.5 million) in his contract.

Rodri's playing style has earned comparisons to Sergio Busquets and, speaking to Marca in June, City coach Mikel Arteta was asked about players who stand out as a no.6. 
“Our position has changed a lot,” he said. “There are already few teams that want to play with a single defensive midfielder, holding the whole game.  
“I'm not talking about City, but in other teams that role is not as defined and we are losing the idea of having one who plays there – the Jorginho type, that I love, or the Busquets type.  
“Rodri? He closely resembles what ‘Busi’ is. Few people read the game alone, those who anticipate scenarios, who are mentally stable, who can be a coach in the field, in the case of Xabi Alonso or Xavi Hernández.” 
   10 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   How do Manchester United rebuild?  
Tony Cascarino has used his Times  column to offer his thoughts, explaining it will take two transfer windows for the club to get on the right track. 
“Yes they need to bring in quality but they need to transform the mentality of the club,” he said. 
“Too many players — and I think Pogba is one of them — play like they are doing Manchester United a favour. Well they’re not: United need players who are desperate and hungry,” insisting the France midfielder's sale would help them massively. 
And while he praised the signing of Daniel James, he believes the club need established quality, too. 
“I would go for a big name first, someone like Marco Verratti from Paris Saint-Germain or, and I know it’s unlikely, put in a massive bid for Chelsea’s N’Golo Kanté. 
  
“More realistic options might be Wilfred Ndidi from Leicester but they desperately need a clever, defensive-minded player to protect the back four. 
“They also need some flair and creativity and if Real Madrid come in for Pogba then United should be asking about Isco and Luka Modric. Isco is a brilliant player who might struggle to get in the Real team with all their new signings and the same could be said for Modric who, while 34 in September, would be brilliant for United for two seasons. 
“They might be in the Europa League but United can offer big wages and playing for them is still a big pull.” 
   11 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   Liverpool could make a move for Tottenham star Christian Eriksen, former Spurs man Jamie O'Hara has claimed.  
Eriksen has admitted he may leave north London this summer as he wants a new challenge, and Real Madrid is his preferred destination. 
However, O'Hara says he believes Liverpool will swoop for Eriksen in a shock summer move. 
“[Liverpool] need a central midfielder player,” he told Sky Sports News. “I’ve got a sneaky suspicion that they might try and take Eriksen from Tottenham as he’s in the last year on his deal. 
“He’s the type of player they need.” 
  
   11 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   Liverpool are being backed to sign Philippe Coutinho this summer despite Manchester United allegedly wanting the Barcelona star.  
Coutinho starred for the Reds before joining Barca in January 2018, but his time in Spain has been tough and a summer exit from Camp Nou is expected. 
United were linked with the Brazil international earlier this week, but at the bookies it is Liverpool who more likely to sign him. 
While PSG are favourites for Coutinho's signature, Liverpool are close second – with Man United far off in third. 
Tottenham, Man City and Arsenal are also included in the market. 
FULL STORY   
 
  
   11 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   West Ham are willing to sell Issa Diop to Man United – as long as they get Anthony Martial in return.  
The Red Devils want highly-rated centre-back Diop this summer but had a bid rejected last week by West Ham. 
Their interest in the 22-year-old remains, however, and the Independent  say the Hammers will sanction a deal as long as Martial is offered in exchange. 
United are not willing to let Martial leave, however. 
  
   11 hours ago June 18, 2019     Billy Hawkins   Gabriel Martinelli is to complete his long-awaited move to Arsenal over the coming days.  
The Brazilian youngster has today turned 18 which means he can leave his homeland for England, and he will pen a five-year contract with the Gunners, Globo Esporte  report. 
The fee is said to be around £6million, and Martinelli recently secured an Italian passport which means he does not need a work permit to join Arsenal. 
The report states Martinelli's transfer will be announced very soon. 
   11 hours ago June 18, 2019     Alex Varney   Charlton Athletic owner Roland Duchatelet has explained to talkSPORT why Lee Bowyer has signed a new contract as manager, just hours after claiming the coach was set to leave the club.  
It was revealed on Tuesday morning that Bowyer – who guided the club to promotion back to the Championship in 2018/19 – has penned a one-year contract extension   after a stunning U-turn over his future. 
It came after Duchatelet announced via a extraordinary statement   on Monday that the manager was set to leave – which was said to have left Bowyer, who was always keen to remain in charge of the club, ‘bewildered’. 
Speaking to Jim White, Duchatelet said: “I was in a problematic situation because I had two objectives: on one hand, sign Lee Bowyer – because I believe he is a major asset to the club – but on the other hand, maintain the ability to sell the club.  
“The problem was his agent was proposing things which would have increased the liability of the club to such an extent that it would have been difficult to sell. Well, increased the difficulty, because it’s difficult already. 
“So we found an agreement, which is in fact a very nice agreement for him, which is good, but it’s also an agreement whereby we do not get into a big liability for the future, which is also very important for us and our ability to sell the club.”

   14 hours ago June 18, 2019     Alex Varney   Romelu Lukaku has been told by Belgium boss Roberto Martinez that he needs to leave Manchester United.   
United are willing to sell the striker this summer if they can recoup close to the £75m what they paid Everton two years, and Inter Milan are keen. 
Lukaku was not a guaranteed starter at Old Trafford this season, with Marcus Rashford seemingly boss Ole Gunnaer Solskjaer’s first chouce striker. 
Martinez, who managed Lukaku at Everton and is now his national team boss, told Belgian newspaper NLN: “It is clear that he has to leave Manchester United. “It would be a good thing for both parties. It is now important that Romelu finds the right club.” 
 
  
   14 hours ago June 18, 2019     Alex Varney   Lee Bowyer has agreed a contract extension at Charlton Athletic – a day after Roland Duchatelet announced he was set for the exit.  
Bowyer looked set to leave the south London club on Monday when their Belgian owner Duchatelet released an extraordinary statement claiming he was not willing to meet the 42-year-old's demands or offer him anything more than a 12-month deal, despite leading the Addicks to promotion last season. 
The announcement surprised the former Leeds and Newcastle midfielder, who has always wanted to stay at the club with whom he began his playing career, and he held further talks with Duchatelet. 
That ended with an agreement being reached, with Charlton announcing on Tuesday morning that Bowyer has put pen-to-pen paper on a new one-year deal. 
 
  
   14 hours ago June 18, 2019     Alex Varney   Aston Villa and Leicester are in a £10m transfer battle for Luton Town youngster James Justin.  
Both Premier League sides are determined to land the 19-year-old defender, with Villa currently edging ahead in the race report The Daily Star.  
   14 hours ago June 18, 2019     Alex Varney    Frank Lampard will hold talks with Roman Abramovich on his yacht this week.  
The Derby County boss and Blues legend is the top target to replace Maurizio Sarri, who left Stamford Bridge for Juventus this week.  
  
Lampard is in France on holiday and plans to meet the Chelsea owner on the £380million Eclipse anchored off glitzy St Tropez to thrash out an agreement, say The Sun.   
John Terry, meanwhile, could replace his close friend and former teammate as Derby manager. 
Terry has been on the coaching staff at Aston Villa since October, helping them win promotion to the Premier League.   
With Lampard set for Chelsea, The Mail  are reporting that Derby owner Mel Morris is now eyeing Terry as a potential replacement.  
Lee Bowyer, who has failed to agree a new contract with Charlton despite leading them to promotion from League One, is also on the Rams’ radar.
