    Watch Wayne Rooney, Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and more battle it out for footballing supremacy, during the FIFA 17 Manchester United FC Player Tournament.

    Spirits ran high during an often tense and excitable match, with both teams putting in a near perfect performance.  
    
 



    



    
         
     



    

    
 



    The first half saw relentless goal attempts by both sides, but the ball just couldn’t find the back of net and the match remained goalless as the half time whistle blew. 
    
 



    



    
         
     



    

    
 



    It wasn’t until the second half that Manchester United’s central midfielder, Paul Pogba, took control of the ball and unleashed a long-range effort that found the top corner, sparking celebrations that were even captured on Ashley Young’s selfie stick! Pogba’s side maintained a comfortable 1-0 lead, which lead them to be crowned winners of the FIFA 17 Manchester United Pro Player Tournament.
