Some existing plans for a second tier to the South Stand will raise the capacity to around 95,000.  

Best way to travel to Old Trafford 
By Train  The train is by far the best option if you travel to Old Trafford. The nearest station is Manchester United Football Ground , this station is located immediately outside the away end. From Manchester Piccadilly Mainline Station, the train has a direct connection to Manchester Piccadilly Mainline Station.
By tram/Metrolink  We would recommend the tram as the second-best option. The other quickest way of getting to Old Trafford (especially for Sunday matches) is to grab a lift on the nearest tram/metrolink. Trams travel every 12 minutes every day of the week. The nearest tram station to Old Trafford is located next to Lancashire County Cricket Club on Warwick Road, which leads straight up to Sir Matt Busby Way and takes about a 10 minutes' walk. 
 
By car  is the third and final option to travel to Old Trafford. There are plenty of small private car parks close to the stadium. The only problem is they tend to fill up pretty early on matchdays. When travelling by car, we recommend you to be there at least one, but preferably two hours before the match.
By bus  There is a bus station called Old Trafford, Matt Busby way located near Old Trafford. Frequent bus services 255, 256, X50 can take you to Old Trafford. However we advise you to take either the bus or the train, since the busses are always filled with people on matchdays.
