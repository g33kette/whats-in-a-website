Don't just take our word for it... 
 



We’ll let these facts speak for themselves! 
 
 


We pay the highest rates 
 
 
You’ll typically get at least 5% more cashback with us than anywhere else in the UK, and if you do find a better rate elsewhere we’ll beat it. 
 


We are world leaders.   
We were the first cashback site in the world to be completely free, and to pass 100% of the cashback onto our members. 
 


We have the most offers 
 
 
We have well over 4,700 stores listed on our site (and this list is always growing). No other UK cashback site has more. 
 

And finally, at the time of writing, we are the highest rated UK cashback website on the independent review site, Trust Pilot.
