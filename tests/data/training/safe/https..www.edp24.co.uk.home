                    Why Judy Garland is still such a beloved star, 50 years on

         It's 50 years next week since Judy Garland's death, aged only 47 - and 2019 also sees the 80th anniversary of The Wizard of Oz. Here's a personal look at her unique appeal.

                    50 years on: Judy Garland self-destructive genius or the girl never allowed to grow up?

         Judy Garland remains one of the legends of Hollywood. Fifty years after her death, her star continues to shine, but, she was also self-destructive and was the architect of her own downfall. But, did she need to surrender to her demons to produce her best work?
