    'It could be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else': Pogba puts Juventus and Real Madrid on red alert as £89million superstar makes startling transfer admission to rock United  
   
  
      
           Paul Pogba hints at move away from Manchester United 
      
        
     
    
      
        
        Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba suggested on Sunday that he could be open to a move away from the Premier League side, telling reporters in Tokyo that now 'could be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else'. The Frenchman has been linked with a move to Real Madrid to work with coach Zinedine Zidane, or with a return to his former club Juventus. Pogba's time at Manchester United has coincided with some insipid performances on the pitch and organisational turmoil at the club.

        Nightmare start for Messi and Co as Argentina begin Copa America campaign with convincing defeat by Colombia  
     
    
        
                 Argentina 0-2 Colombia: Goals from Roger Martinez and Duvan Zapata 
            
              
         
        
        
            
            Lionel Messi's quest for international silverware got off to a bad start against Colombia in the Copa America on Saturday night. Argentina barely managed a touch in their opponents' box in the first half, and then it was Colombia who broke the deadlock after 71 minutes with a fine strike from Roger Martinez.  Argentina went in search of an equaliser, but things went from bad to worse as Duvan Zapata converted a cross from close range to make it 2-0.

    A lot of cash for Rash! Man United faced with prospect of paying Rashford £350K a WEEK to stave off Real Madrid and Barcelona 
   
  
         Man United may have to pay Rashford £350K to scare off Madrid and Barcelona 
    
      
   
  
    
      
      Manchester United may soon find themselves in a position where Marcus Rashford has to be paid an eye-watering £350,000 per week, according to reports. United, who are going through a turbulent period of transition, are in the vulnerable position of having to negotiate a new deal for Rashford as he enters the final 12 months of his contract. The Red Devils may have to pay the huge figure in order to keep the player out of the grasps of Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona, as report the Sun.

Henderson will be a Premier League goalkeeper one way or the other, after working his way up via the loan system to earn his chance to shine on the biggest stage. And if his last few seasons are anything to go by, it is only a matter of time before the England and Manchester United goalkeeper-in-waiting is a household name.

He replaced positional rival David Neres in the 81st minute of his country's Copa America win over Bolivia in Sao Paulo on Friday night, with Tite's men already leading 2-0 thanks to a brace from a revitalised Philippe Coutinho.

        From the Manchester City maestro to the Manchester United target: The five England Under-21 kids hoping to make the step up to the senior side by starring at the Euros 
     
    
        
                 The five England Under-21 kids hoping to make the step up to the senior side 
            
              
         
        
        
            
            It has been a difficult 12 months for England's junior teams, with some disappointing results, but the Under-21s are ready to restore pride. While the Under-17s floundered at the European Championship in May and the Under-20s fell way short in their quest to win the Toulon Tournament for the fourth consecutive year, Aidy Boothroyd's squad have the potential to do great things. The Under-21 Euros is a competition that has proven to be a rich breeding ground for future stars and in the last decade players such as Jordan Henderson, Danny Rose, John Stones, Jesse Lingard, Jordan Pickford and Ben Chilwell have used it as a platform to play for England's senior team.

    Venezuela's Del Pino sees red after Peru have TWO goals ruled out by VAR in Copa America stalemate 
   
  
         Venezuela 0-0 Peru: Christofer Gonzales and Jefferson Farfan have goals ruled out by VAR 
    
      
   
  
    
      
      Venezuela and Peru began their Copa America with a nervous draw on Saturday in a match marked by two Peruvian goals chalked off after consultation with the Video Assistant Referee. Christofer Gonzales' 11th-minute goal was disallowed for offside earlier in the move and then Jefferson Farfan suffered the same fate 19 minutes into the second half after his header hit the net. The game grew more tense after Venezuela had Luis Mago sent off with 16 minutes remaining.

        He was United's big-money signing... now Lukaku's future is up in the air: United aim to recoup £80m for striker who Conte wants to be his new Diego Costa at Inter Milan 
     
    
        
                 Romelu Lukaku's future is up in the air as Man United try and recoup £80m for the Belgian 
            
              
         
        
        
            
            JACK GAUGHAN: Romelu Lukaku's immediate future is one of uncertainty and the striker does not have a clear idea where he will be turning up for pre-season training next month. There is an element of every club waiting for another to kick into action so their own transfer window can truly start and the situation surrounding Lukaku is no different. Manchester United are open to selling the 26-year-old but are not absolutely desperate if no suitable bids are forthcoming.

            Vivianne Miedema scored twice to become Holland's all-time leading goalscorer as the European champions beat Cameroon 3-1 on Saturday to reach the last 16 at the Women's World Cup. Playing Holland for the first time in a competitive match, Cameroon adopted a cautious approach at Stade du Hainaut, with five players in the back line and another four in front of them for the majority of the game. The tactics worked until a sweeping Dutch move in which Shanice van de Sanden's inch-perfect cross found Arsenal forward Miedema, who powered home a thumping header at the back post.

      Canada have booked their place in the last 16 of the Women's World Cup following a comfortable victory over New Zealand in Grenoble. Jessie Fleming opened the scoring at the Stade des Alps by losing her marker and picking out the bottom corner with a slotted effort. As the celebrations subsided, Canada confirmed the victory in the latter stages after Nichelle Prince tsabbed home from close range after Christine Sinclair struck the woodwork with a powerful header.

         Zaha hints at Crystal Palace stay despite earlier stating Champions League ambitions 
    
      
   
  
    
      
      Wilfried Zaha has hinted that he wants to stay at Crystal Palace next season, despite previously stating his Champions League ambitions. The fiery winger was raised in Thornton Heath, a stone's throw from Palace's Selhurst Park home, and still lives close to his friends and family in south London.  Now 26, Zaha has been tipped for a big-money summer move, and in a recent interview with Sportsmail, he detailed his ambitions to play for a top-four side.

    Arsenal 'refusing to sell midfielder Lucas Torreira this summer' amid links to AC Milan 
   
  
    
           
      
        
     
    
      
    \t
    \tArsenal reportedly have no intention of allowing midfielder Lucas Torreira go during the summer transfer window. The 23-year-old has been heavily linked with a possible switch to AC Milan recently. Torreira moved to the Gunners in a £25million deal from Sampdoria only last July and has admitted that adapting to life in England has been difficult.
