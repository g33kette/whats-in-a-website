With all this warm weather, you can finally enjoy your garden again, so indulge a little. Take the garden furniture  out of the shed  and set up a parasol to keep you protected from the sun.

Between camping supplies, sports equipment and fitness and cycling gear, we've got all you need to make the most of the summer. It's important for kids to stay active, so why not join them? We stock both adults and kids' bikes  so, there's really no excuse not to. We've also got a huge range of outdoor toys to keep them amused in the garden. There are sand pits, trampolines, swings, hoverboards and, who could forget the quintessential feature of a British garden in the summertime - paddling pools ! Inflatable pools are a brilliant way for the kids to have an energetic splash around. And with a family-sized paddling pool, you can take a cool dip in the water yourself.
