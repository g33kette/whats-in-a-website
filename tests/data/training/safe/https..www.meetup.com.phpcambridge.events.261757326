Location image of event venue            Details  Ruth Ivimey-Cook hosts a PHP roundtable this evening where we plan to chat about current topics in the PHP industry and answer any questions you may have. Please come along with any topics you'd like to discuss or questions you would like answered. Any topic is open, from beginner to advanced areas.  Some ideas include:  * Where to start when learning PHP? * What version of PHP should I be using? * How do you test code / applications? * What is best practise in PHP? What sort of thing should people be doing to create robust, maintainable web apps?  We look forward to an interesting evening of discussion. Please come along!  If you can have a think about what sort of questions you'd either like to discuss or have answered by the panel please let us know when signing up for the event. You can also get in touch via Meetup.  ---  We're meeting at 6:30pm for a 7:00pm start. Pizzas and drinks provided by local digital design and technology agency Studio 24.

Simon R J.    hi all - due to low attendee signups we've had to sadly cancel the event this month. We're going to chat about future plans & make sure we sort out a great event for the future. We hope to make the panel discussion idea part of a future event, since it was a really good idea. Sorry for those looking forward to the event this week & look forward to seeing you at a future one :)   7 days ago                    PHP Cambridge  PHP Cambridge See more events               Show more event details      Find more events in Tech   See all     ChefConf Comes to London!!!
