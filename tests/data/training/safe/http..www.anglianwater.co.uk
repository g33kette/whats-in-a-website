In some areas the sewer network has been inundated by the flood water and our treatment works are unable to process the sheer volume of water all at once, but we are doing everything we can to ensure our equipment is performing as well as possible.
Please be rest assured the clean water supply in the area is unaffected - there are no issues with your tap water and you can continue to use your supply as normal.
Please share this post in your local Facebook group and help us keep local residents informed.

                                            We are very excited to announce British Olympic sailor Ben Saxton as an ambassador for Anglian Water. He will be helping us spread the water safety message at our reservoirs this summer. He has a great connection with Anglian Water and our reservoirs - he first learnt to sail at Grafham Water in Cambridgeshire, and his grandfather was the first manager at the nearby treatment works when it opened 50 years ago! We’re currently producing a video in which Ben explains the dangers of swimming in open water and encourages everyone to enjoy our reservoirs safely.
