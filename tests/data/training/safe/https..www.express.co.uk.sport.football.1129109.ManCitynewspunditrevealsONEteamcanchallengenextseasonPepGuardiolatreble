City won the FA Cup yesterday with an incredible 6-0 win over Watford at Wembley Stadium, their third major trophy of the season. Having already secured the Premier League and Carabao Cup this term, Manchester City  went into the game as heavy favourites and showed good reason for being so with a quick start. David Silva opened the scoring after 26 minutes, before Gabriel Jesus doubled the lead ten minutes later.

City became the first men’s team in English football history to win the domestic treble, but Pep Guardiola told reporters after the game that he still believes his side can improve. They nearly missed out on winning the Premier League this season, having been pushed to the wire by Liverpool . In the end, by losing out on the title by just one point, the Reds secured the highest points total in Premier League history other than City’s last two campaigns.
